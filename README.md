## Overview

This project is a modern take on the classic lane runner genre, inspired by games like Subway Surfers but simplified for a web experience. The player controls a car trying to dodge incoming obstacle cars across three lanes.

*   **Gameplay:** Navigate left and right to switch lanes and avoid collisions.
*   **Scoring:** The score increases based on the distance traveled (simulated by game speed).
*   **Difficulty:** The game gradually speeds up, increasing the challenge over time.
*   **High Score:** Your best score is saved locally using `localStorage`.
*   **Controls:** Playable with keyboard (A/D or Arrow Keys) and touch swipes (Left/Right) on mobile/tablet.
*   **Theme:** Features a sleek dark mode by default with a toggle for light mode.
*   **End Game:** When the player collides with an obstacle, an end screen displays the final score and high score, offering options to play again or return home.
*   **Vibe Coding:** This project was developed with significant assistance from AI, focusing on rapid iteration, modern UI implementation (Tailwind CSS), and core game logic setup.

## Features

*   **3-Lane Runner Mechanics:** Core gameplay involves switching between three distinct lanes.
*   **Dynamic Obstacle Spawning:** Obstacles appear randomly in lanes at an increasing frequency.
*   **Progressive Difficulty:** Game speed and obstacle spawn rate increase over time.
*   **Score & High Score Tracking:** Real-time score display during gameplay and persistent high score using `localStorage`.
*   **Responsive Controls:** Supports both keyboard (A/D, Left/Right Arrows) and touch swipe gestures.
*   **Dark/Light Theme Toggle:** Easily switch between visual themes, saved to `localStorage`.
*   **Modern UI/UX:** Clean and visually appealing interface built with React and Tailwind CSS.
*   **Multiple Screens:** Includes Start, Game, and End screens, plus a "How to Play" modal.
*   **Component-Based Architecture:** Built with reusable React components.
*   **Smooth Animations & Transitions:** Utilizes CSS transitions for player movement and UI elements.
*   **Efficient Development:** Bootstrapped with Vite for a fast development experience.
*   **Iconography:** Uses `react-icons` for UI elements like theme toggle, modal controls, and buttons.

## Tech Stack
